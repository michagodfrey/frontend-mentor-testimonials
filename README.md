## My process

This was one of the first Frontend Mentor projects I built when I was still very new to web development. My goal was to complete in a few hours and I managed to do that, albeit with a few accessibility issues and style issues on the first iteration. I have since addressed those and improved this.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
